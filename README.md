# SENG3210_B-T_Doc

Our project for SENG3210 (Applied Software Engineering) is an android application called the Online Voting System (OVS). 

OVS has two types of users that can log in, the "voters" and the "managers". Voters can view different topics, select them, and vote for any of the options presented to them. Managers can create topics, delete topics, and see how many votes each topic has for its options.

To login as a manager: try username u1 and password u1.

To login as a voter: try username u2 and password u2 or u3 + p3.
